# PromptGen MCP Server

A **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server that enhances your prompts with 47+ advanced prompt engineering techniques, automatically selecting the best techniques based on your question type and providing relevant code context from your workspace.

## What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that allows AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and others to connect with external tools and data sources. Think of it as a way to give your AI assistant superpowers by connecting it to specialized services.

This MCP server acts as a "prompt enhancement engine" that:
- üß† **Analyzes your questions** to understand what you're trying to accomplish
- üîç **Scans your workspace** to find relevant code context
- üéØ **Selects optimal techniques** from 47+ prompt engineering methods
- ‚ú® **Generates enhanced prompts** that get better AI responses

## Features

### üöÄ **Intelligent Technique Selection**
Automatically chooses from 47+ prompt engineering techniques including:
- **Chain of Thought** - Step-by-step reasoning
- **Few-Shot Learning** - Learning from examples
- **Plan and Solve** - Structured problem solving
- **Self-Ask** - Breaking down complex questions
- **Tree of Thought** - Exploring multiple solution paths
- **And 42 more advanced techniques...**

### üîç **Smart Code Context**
- Scans your entire workspace for relevant files
- Extracts pertinent code snippets based on your question
- Includes file paths and line numbers for precise context
- Maintains complete privacy - all code analysis happens locally

### üéØ **Question-Aware Enhancement**
Analyzes your questions to determine:
- **Question Type**: debugging, optimization, architecture, implementation, etc.
- **Complexity Level**: simple, moderate, high
- **Best Techniques**: automatically selects 2-4 optimal techniques
- **Context Needs**: finds relevant code files and functions

## Quick Setup

### 1. Get API Keys (Free Tiers Available)
```bash
# Required API keys:
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key_here          # Free: 6,000 requests/day
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key_here      # Free: 1,000 searches/month
PROMPTGEN_API_KEY=your_promptgen_key     # Get from promptgen.dev/api
```

### 2. Install MCP Server
Add this configuration to your `~/.cursor/mcp_servers.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prompt-gen": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/prompt-gen-mcp/src/prompt_gen_mcp/server.py"],
      "env": {
        "GROQ_API_KEY": "your_groq_key_here",
        "TAVILY_API_KEY": "your_tavily_key_here", 
        "PROMPTGEN_API_KEY": "your_promptgen_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Restart Cursor
Completely restart Cursor IDE to load the MCP server.

### 4. Start Enhancing!
Use the **Command Palette** (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for "MCP" to access the `enhance_prompt` tool.

## How It Works

### Input: Simple Question
```
"How do I optimize this React component?"
```

### Output: Enhanced Prompt
```
# Code Context Analysis
Based on your workspace scan, I found these relevant files:
- src/components/UserProfile.tsx (lines 45-89)
- src/hooks/useUserData.ts (lines 12-34)

# Selected Prompt Engineering Techniques

## Chain of Thought
Let's approach this optimization systematically:
1. First, analyze current performance bottlenecks
2. Then, identify optimization opportunities
3. Finally, implement improvements step by step

## Plan and Solve
**Plan**: Break down the optimization into measurable steps
**Solve**: Apply specific React optimization patterns

# Enhanced Question
Given the React component in src/components/UserProfile.tsx that handles user data fetching and rendering, how can I optimize its performance considering:

1. **Rendering efficiency**: Are there unnecessary re-renders?
2. **Data fetching**: Can we improve the useUserData hook?
3. **Memory usage**: Are there potential memory leaks?
4. **Bundle size**: Can we reduce the component's footprint?

Please provide specific code improvements with before/after examples.
```

## Supported AI Assistants

- ‚úÖ **Cursor IDE** (Primary support)
- ‚úÖ **Claude Desktop** (with MCP configuration)
- ‚úÖ **Cline** (VS Code extension)
- ‚úÖ **Windsurf** (with MCP setup)
- ‚úÖ **Any MCP-compatible client**

## Privacy & Security

- üîí **Local Code Analysis**: All workspace scanning happens on your machine
- üåê **API-Only Techniques**: Only technique selection uses external API
- üîê **No Code Upload**: Your code never leaves your computer
- üéØ **Minimal Data**: Only question analysis sent to technique API

## Architecture

```
Your Question ‚Üí Local Workspace Scan ‚Üí Technique API ‚Üí Enhanced Prompt
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì (Private)           ‚Üì (Public)        ‚Üì
  "Optimize     Finds relevant      Selects optimal    Returns enhanced
   React app"   code files         techniques         prompt with context
```

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Starting?
```bash
# Check if Python dependencies are installed
pip install fastmcp sentence-transformers httpx

# Verify API keys are set
echo $GROQ_API_KEY
echo $TAVILY_API_KEY  
echo $PROMPTGEN_API_KEY
```

### Tool Not Appearing in Cursor?
1. Verify `~/.cursor/mcp_servers.json` exists and has correct format
2. Restart Cursor completely (not just reload window)
3. Check Command Palette for "MCP" options
4. Look for MCP status in Cursor's status bar

### Getting API Errors?
- **GROQ**: Verify API key at console.groq.com
- **Tavily**: Check quota at tavily.com/dashboard  
- **PromptGen**: Confirm key at promptgen.dev/api
